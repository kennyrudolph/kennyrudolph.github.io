    <h1>First Github Pages Project</h1>
    <h2>And Git / Command Line Practice</h2>

    <p>The question is not really if using Github is an effective use of resources, but whether or not Github fits within my needs and methods. I am sure I can spend the time to be come proficient and efficient with Git and Github. Although the time and nervousness the process may cause could render doing so not worth it.</p>

    <p class="question">So is that true for the command line?</p>

    <p>My anwser is... maybe. It might very well be time consuming, and completely unecessary for my goals for designing websites. However, in theory, it is reminisent of my early computer days as a kid, makes more sense, seems familiar, and may prove to be fun. Having fun might be able to over ride the usefulness aspect.</p>
